<h1><b>LONDON TENNIS CLUB</b></h1>

<ol>
<li>
<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
My first project with Code Institute was to create a static front-end site to present useful information to users using HTML and CSS. London Tennis Club is a site that looks to connect keen tennis players of all abilities, living in London, so that they can play tennis whenever and wherever suits them and make new friends and socialise. The site is targeted towards people who want to play tennis but are struggling to find players within their current social group that are free and available at the same time as them. The site also provides information on public tennis courts in North, East, South and West of London.

<h2><u>Features</u></h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Header and Navigation bar</h3></li>
A fixed header is featured on all three pages of the site, allowing the user to navigate with ease through links to the Home page, Join Us (registration form) page and the London Tennis Courts information page. There is an additional Home page link in the shape of a tennis ball in the top left hand corner of the page to provide further ease for the user to navigate back to the landing page, and to add to the general aesthetics of the site that is tennis related.

<li><h3>Landing page image</h3></li>
The landing page image includes an aerial photo of a tennis court with two players playing tennis that stretches across the full width of the screen. There is also a cover text that overlays the image to describe in short the purpose of the site for the user.

<li><h3>How it Works section</h3></li>
The How it Works section allows the user to see immediately how the site works and how it could benefit them in four easy steps. Icons and a background image have been included to add to the overall aesthetics of the page.

<li><h3>Footer</h3></li>
Social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Linkedin have been included in the footer section of each page, and each link will open in a new tab to allow the user to stay on the site. The purpose of the social media links is to allow users to stay in touch and promote the site using social media.

<li><h3>Join Us page</h3></li>
The Join Us page is to allow the user to sign up to the site and join the community of London tennis players. The form requires users to submit information including their full name, email address, date of birth, gender and tennis ability. This information will allow the site to contact users and pair them with players of similar ability. A reset button has been added to allow users to quickly reset the form if needed as there are several lines of information requried.

<li><h3>London Tennis Courts page</h3></li>
This page shows useful information on public tennis courts available in North, East, South and West London. Information include a brief summary of the courts, the website link, an email address and the address and Google map of the location of the courts.

<h2>Future features</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Blog page</h3></li>
For users to interact with each other more efficiently and discuss all things tennis from tennis courts, rackets, to professional matches and results being played around the world.

<li><h3>Photo/Gallery page</h3></li>
A page for users to upload images of their matches and the friends they have played with.

<li><h3>Merchandise/shopping page</h3></li>
To allow users to purchase new equipment and clothing from retailers and suppliers, and an additional feature allowing users to sell their old tennis racquets and equipment. These features will have the potential to allow the site to generate new revenue streams and provide a sustainability message to users. 
</ul>

<h2>Typography and color scheme</h2>
I have chosen a green and orange colour scheme as well as a bold font. Both provide a vibrant, modern and friendly site that will hopefully appeal to users. The green is also a colour associated with the Wimbledon tennis championship in London, a Grand Slam event that is well known around the world.

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
Using Balsamiq a basic wireframe was created to outline what I wanted to achieve with the site, with the initial layout and information required for each page.
